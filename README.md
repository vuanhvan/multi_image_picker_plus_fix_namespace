# multi_image_picker_plus

Flutter plugin that allows you to display multi image picker on iOS and Android.

Thanks to [Sh1d0w](https://github.com/Sh1d0w/), this plugin was first created by him, but he stopped updating it a long time ago, and now [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) can't find this plugin, but I think it is very useful for me, so I upgraded it to the latest version and re-issued it. For previously used multi_ image_ For the developers of picker, the use of Android is not much different from that before, but many configurations have been modified on IOS. These configurations can be found in the [BSImagePicker](https://github.com/mikaoj/BSImagePicker) document.

## **Installation**

### IOS

Add the following keys to your *Info.plist* file, located in `<project root>/ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

- `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` - describe why your app needs permission for the photo library. This is called *Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description* in the visual editor.
    - This permission is not required for image picking on iOS 11+ if you pass `false` for `requestFullMetadata`.

### Android

Add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml`, located in `<project root>/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```

If your app targets Android 13 with targetSdk >= 33 then you will need to replace READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission to this in your `AndroidManifest.xml`.
[Android documentation here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/behavior-changes-13#granular-media-permissions)

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES" />
<uses-permission
    android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"
    android:maxSdkVersion="32" />
```

## Usage

```dart
resultList = await MultiImagePicker.pickImages(
  selectedAssets: images,
  cupertinoOptions: CupertinoOptions(
    doneButton: UIBarButtonItem(title: 'Confirm', tintColor: colorScheme.primary),
    cancelButton: UIBarButtonItem(title: 'Cancel', tintColor: colorScheme.primary),
    albumButtonColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primary,
  ),
  materialOptions: const MaterialOptions(
		maxImages: 300,
	  enableCamera: true,
    actionBarColor: "#abcdef",
    actionBarTitle: "Example App",
    allViewTitle: "All Photos",
    useDetailsView: false,
    selectCircleStrokeColor: "#000000",
  ),
);
